# **HYPOTHESIS TESTING WITH SCIPY**

  Familiar, a startup of blood transfusion! This Hypothesis testing is focused on developing `Familiar's` marketing strategy.**

## Project Goals:
   - Finding out if the average lifespan of a Vein Pack subscriber is significantly different from the average life expectancy of 71 years. (1 sample T-test)
   - Showing that the subscribers to the Artery Pack experience a significant improvement even beyond what a Vein Pack subscriberâ€™s benefits. (2 sample T-test) 
   - Need to be able to tell if what seems like a higher number of our Artery Package subscribers is a significant difference from what was reported by Vein Package subscribers.(Chi-Square Test)   [Click Here To See The Project](https://github.com/Emon-ProCoder7/Data-Driven-Decision-Making-With-Statistics/blob/master/Marketing%20Development.ipynb)
