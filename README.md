## 01. Sample Size Determination

  Sample size determination for, Nosh Mish Mosh, a recipe and ingredient meal delivery service. They ship the raw materials and people get to cook it at their home! These rainbow fingerling potatoes don’t come cheap. They’d like to know for sure that they’ll be pulling in at least $1240 more every week. In order to make product and interface A/B testing decisions to grab more customers, here survey sample size determination is needed for decision making.
  
### Project Goals:
  - Baseline Conversion Rate.
  - Lift
  - Statistical Significance at 90%
  - What amount of customers need to be surveyed.

## 02. Determining a Perfect Price Point Through A/B Test

  Product Manager at FarmBurg, a company that makes a farming simulation social network game. In the FarmBurg game, people can plow, plant, and harvest different crops.The product manager has been conducting an A/B Test with three different variants.
  
  

### Project Goals:
   They are trying to get users to purchase a small FarmBurg upgrade package. It’s called a microtransaction. They’re not sure how much to charge for it, so they tested three different price points: 
   1. 0.99 $   
   2. 1.99$, and 
   3. 4.99 $.
   
   I have done binomial test to determine that price point decision.

## 03. Startup's Marketing Strategy Development

  Familiar, a startup of blood transfusion! This Hypothesis testing is focused on developing `Familiar's` marketing strategy.

### Project Goals:
   - Finding out if the average lifespan of a Vein Pack subscriber is significantly different from the average life expectancy of 71 years. (1 sample T-test)
   - Showing that the subscribers to the Artery Pack experience a significant improvement even beyond what a Vein Pack subscriber’s benefits. (2 sample T-test) 
   - Need to be able to tell if what seems like a higher number of our Artery Package subscribers is a significant difference from what was reported by Vein Package subscribers.(Chi-Square Test)

## 04. Match Maker Startup, Management System Development

  FetchMaker’s mission is to match up prospective dog owners with their perfect pet. Data on thousands of adoptable dogs are in FetchMaker’s system.
  
### Project Goals:
   - Over the years, it have been seen that 8% of dogs in the FetchMaker system expected to be rescued. The CEO wants to know if whippets are significantly more or less likely to be a rescue.
   - Three of their most popular mid-sized dog breeds are whippets, terriers, and pitbulls. Is there a significant difference in the average weights of these three dog breeds? 
   - Which of the pairs of these dog breeds differ from each other.
   - Lets see if "poodle"s and "shihtzu"s have significantly different color breakdowns.
