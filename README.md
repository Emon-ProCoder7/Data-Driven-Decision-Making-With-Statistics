  Familiar, a startup of blood transfusion! This Hypothesis testing is focused on developing `Familiar's` marketing strategy.

### Project Goals:
   - Finding out if the average lifespan of a Vein Pack subscriber is significantly different from the average life expectancy of 71 years. (1 sample T-test)
   - Showing that the subscribers to the Artery Pack experience a significant improvement even beyond what a Vein Pack subscriber’s benefits. (2 sample T-test) 
   - Need to be able to tell if what seems like a higher number of our Artery Package subscribers is a significant difference from what was reported by Vein Package subscribers.(Chi-Square Test)

## Match Maker Startup, Management System Development

  FetchMaker’s mission is to match up prospective dog owners with their perfect pet. Data on thousands of adoptable dogs are in FetchMaker’s system.
  
### Project Goals:
   - Over the years, it have been seen that 8% of dogs in the FetchMaker system expected to be rescued. The CEO wants to know if whippets are significantly more or less likely to be a rescue.
   - Three of their most popular mid-sized dog breeds are whippets, terriers, and pitbulls. Is there a significant difference in the average weights of these three dog breeds? 
   - Which of the pairs of these dog breeds differ from each other.
   - Lets see if "poodle"s and "shihtzu"s have significantly different color breakdowns.
